[myWeatherForecast challenge by Juan Alba Maldonado]

TODO list:

*) Improve the ugly design by CSS/CSS3 and add transition and cool effects. Adapt it to mobile devices.

*) Stop displaying ISO country codes and display full country names.

*) Localize the app for different languages (and auto-detect the preferred user language the first time) and format numbers and dates according to the country/language. Consider using "today" and "tomorrow" words.

*) Add security measures, flood protection and so on.

*) Learn more about Ember.js and do the things following more strictly its design pattern.

*) Think about caching results for future searches (even for different users).

*) Make it SEO friendly by creating routes (and their URIs) for searched text (representing a city or list of cities).

*) When we are seeing the weather of a city (route /city/:city_id) and we press browser's back button, the previous page does not renders again.

*) Clean, simplify and refactorize code.
